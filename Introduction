Computational Linguistics (CL) is now a very active sub-discipline in applied linguistics. 
Its main focus is on the computational text analytics, which is essentially about leveraging computational tools,
techniques, and algorithms to process and understand natural language data (in spoken or textual formats).
Therefore, this course aims to introduce useful strategies and common workflows that have been widely adopted 
by data scientists to extract useful insights from natural language data. In this course, we will focus on textual data.
